### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am Abdullah Nafees from Lahore

I did my *Bachelors in Computer Science* in 2014 from Forman Christian College, Lahore. 

During my bachelors I was interested and studied Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, Embedded Systems, and Computer Vision.

My final year project was a smart doorbell called **S.E.R.I.C.** which stands for:
**S**mart
**E**mbedded
**R**edundant
**I**OT
**C**amera. It used Raspberry Pi and OpenBR to perform facial recognition to perform smart functions such as open a door, send and recieve messages, and stream live video.

After my bachelors, I worked as an Implementation Engineer at a local health tech startup where I was responsible for implementing digital solutions for hospital management.

I joined Arbisoft in 2020 as an Implementation Analyst and worked towards being a Customer Success Specialist. 

Currently, I am working on Django and Django-REST frameworks.

You can reach out to me if you would like to talk about programming, AI, DL and anything related to pop culture such as _Back to the Future_.
