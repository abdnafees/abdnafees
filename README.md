### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am Abdullah Nafees from Lahore

I did my *Bachelors in Computer Science* in 2014 from Forman Christian College, Lahore. 

During my bachelor's, I was interested in and studied Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, Embedded Systems, and Computer Vision.

My final year project was a smart doorbell called **S.E.R.I.C.** which stands for:
**S**mart
**E**mbedded
**R**edundant
**I**OT
**C**amera. It used Raspberry Pi and OpenBR to perform facial recognition to perform smart functions such as opening a door, sending and receiving messages, and streaming live video.

After my bachelor's, I worked as an Implementation Engineer at a local health tech startup where I was responsible for implementing digital solutions for hospital management.

I joined Arbisoft in 2020 as an Implementation Analyst.

I am currently working at Arbisoft as a Software Engineer where I am working on a custom Moodle based LMS using PHP, JavaScript and React.

You can reach out to me if you would like to talk about programming, AI, DL, and anything related to pop culture such as _Back to the Future_.
