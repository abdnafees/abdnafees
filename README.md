### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am Abdullah Nafees from Lahore

I did my *Bachelor in Computer Science* in 2014 from Forman Christian College, Lahore. 

During my bachelor's, I was interested in and studied Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, Embedded Systems, and Computer Vision.

My final year project was a smart doorbell called **S.E.R.I.C.** which stands for:
**S**mart
**E**mbedded
**R**edundant
**I**OT
**C**amera. It used Raspberry Pi and OpenBR to perform facial recognition and smart functions such as opening a door, sending and receiving messages, and streaming live video.

After my bachelor's, I worked as an Implementation Engineer at a local health tech startup where I was responsible for implementing digital solutions for hospital management.

I joined Arbisoft in 2020 as an Implementation Analyst but moved to software engineering 2 years ago.

I am currently working at Arbisoft as a Software Engineer where I have worked on a custom Moodle-based LMS using PHP, JavaScript, and React.

I am currently designing a Bootcamp for fresh grads at Arbisoft in partnership with LUMS.

Feel free to contact me for contract, freelance, open source opportunities or if you would like to talk about programming, AI, DL, and anything related to pop culture such as _Back to the Future_.
